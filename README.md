# reflected-XSS-demo
This project demonstrates a realistic Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack in a simulated delivery tracking scenario, mimicking the Belgian postal service Bpost. It includes a phishing login page, a fake email, and a redirection to the real Bpost site after credential capture.
